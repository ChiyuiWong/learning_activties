# Poll System Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented an interactive poll system with the following features:
- **Backend**: Flask RESTful API with MongoDB integration using MongoEngine
- **Frontend**: HTML, Bootstrap 5, and vanilla JavaScript
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for teachers and students
- **Database**: MongoDB with proper indexing for optimal performance

## Components

### Backend Components
1. **Data Models** (poll.py):
   - `Poll` document with embedded `Option` documents
   - `Vote` document with references to Poll and student ID
   - Proper indexing for optimal query performance

2. **API Endpoints** (polls_routes.py):
   - Create poll (teacher only)
   - List polls (filtered by course)
   - Vote on poll (student only)
   - Get poll results
   - Close poll (teacher only)

3. **Authentication** (security/routes.py):
   - JWT token-based authentication
   - Role-based access control (teacher vs student)

### Frontend Components
1. **User Interface** (polls.html):
   - Responsive design using Bootstrap 5
   - Login form with role selection
   - Poll creation form for teachers
   - Interactive poll voting for students
   - Visual results display with progress bars

2. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - Authentication and session management
   - Dynamic poll creation and listing
   - Interactive voting mechanism
   - Real-time results display
   - User-friendly alerts and notifications

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure
```
Poll:
  - question: String
  - options: List[Option]
  - created_by: String (teacher ID)
  - is_active: Boolean
  - created_at: DateTime
  - expires_at: DateTime (optional)
  - course_id: String

Option:
  - text: String
  - votes: Integer

Vote:
  - poll: Reference(Poll)
  - student_id: String
  - option_index: Integer
  - voted_at: DateTime
```

### Security Features
- Unique constraint prevents students from voting multiple times on the same poll
- Only teachers can create and close polls
- JWT token validation for all API endpoints

## Testing
A comprehensive test script (`test_poll_system.py`) is provided to verify:
- Poll creation functionality
- Poll listing API
- Voting mechanism
- Results calculation
- Poll closure

## How to Use
1. Start the Flask server: `python app.py`
2. Access the poll system at: `http://localhost:5000/polls`
3. Login with:
   - Teacher: username=teacher1, password=password123
   - Student: username=student1, password=password123
4. Create polls as a teacher or vote as a student

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time updates using WebSockets
- Advanced poll types (multiple choice, open-ended)
- Analytics dashboard for teachers
- Integration with course management system
