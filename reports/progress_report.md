# COMP5241 Group 10 - Progress Report

## Project Information
- **Group Number**: 10
- **Course**: COMP5241
- **Report Date**: September 17, 2025

## Meeting Summary
- **First Team Meeting**: September 17, 2025
- **Meeting Focus**: Project planning and initial requirement analysis
- **Outcome**: Team decided to prioritize core requirements implementation

## Technology Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Python 3.11 with Flask
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Development Approach**: Core requirements first, then extended features

## Team Structure & Responsibilities

### Team Members and Division of Work

| Team Member | Primary Responsibilities |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Ting** | GenAI related components and features |
| **Sunny** | Security implementation and admin functionalities |
| **Joyce** | UI/UX design and frontend development |
| **Charlie** | Learning activities modules and course management |
| **Keith** | Learning activities modules and teacher course creation |

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed Tasks
- [x] Initial team meeting and project kickoff
- [x] Technology stack selection and approval
- [x] Team role assignment and responsibility distribution
- [x] Project requirement analysis (based on project_overview.pdf)
- [x] Decision to focus on core requirements first

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] Environment setup and development infrastructure
- [ ] Detailed requirement specification for each module
- [ ] Database schema design for MongoDB
- [ ] Flask application structure planning

### ðŸ“‹ Planned Tasks (Next Phase)
- [ ] **Ting**: Research and design GenAI integration architecture
- [ ] **Sunny**: Security framework implementation and admin panel design
- [ ] **Joyce**: UI wireframes and design system creation
- [ ] **Charlie & Keith**: Learning activities workflow design and teacher course creation modules
- [ ] Team: API design and endpoint specification
- [ ] Team: Database collection structure and relationships

## Development Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Core requirements implementation
   - Focus on essential functionalities as specified in project requirements
   - Establish solid foundation for the application
   
2. **Phase 2**: Extended features (if time permits)
   - Additional features beyond core requirements
   - Performance optimization and enhancement

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Backend**: Python 3.11 + Flask chosen for rapid development and team familiarity
- **Database**: MongoDB selected for flexible schema and scalability
- **Development Approach**: Modular development with clear separation of responsibilities

## Next Meeting
- **Scheduled**: October 8, 2025
- **Agenda**: 
  - Review individual progress on assigned components
  - Finalize API design and database schema
  - Set up development environment and project repository structure
  - Define coding standards and collaboration workflow

## Challenges & Risks
- **Identified Risks**: 
  - Coordination between different modules (GenAI, Security, UI, Learning Activities)
  - Integration complexity between Flask backend and MongoDB
  - Time management for core vs extended features

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
  - Regular communication and progress updates
  - Clear API contracts between modules
  - Incremental development and testing approach

## Notes
- All team members committed to prioritizing core requirements
- Technology stack approved by all team members
- Individual research and preparation phase to begin immediately
